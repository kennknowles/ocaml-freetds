=====================

https://github.com/kennknowles/ocaml-freetds

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/kennknowles/ocaml-freetds.png)](https://travis-ci.org/kennknowles/ocaml-freetds)

An O'Caml binding to the `ct-lib` portion of the `freetds` library, for interfacing with Sybase and Microsoft SQL databases.


Feature Summary
---------------

 - Direct binding to the `ct-lib` interface
 - Supports `Dbi_freetds` module included with `ocamldbi` 


Known Bugs And Limitations
--------------------------

 - Some data types, such as datetimes, are returned as strings,
   because I haven't had time to write a good binding for them yet.

 - It would be nice to bind the dblib interface as well, and maybe
   even have the DBI module be able to use either, because I understand
   they have slightly different features


Installation
------------

Quick Version:

```
$ tar xjvf ocaml-freetds-<version>.tar.bz2
$ cd ocaml-freetds-<version>
$ make
$ make install
```

Long Version:

1)	`make`
	This will build ocaml-freetds according to your ./configure instructions.

2)	`make install`
	You may need to run this as root, or someone with permissions to the findlib's destdir.
	This should install ocaml-freetds as a findlib package, so you can use
	'ocamlfind' to build things with it.

Other things to build:

 - You can also build a toplevel with "make freetds.top"

## Special OSX Instructions

This seems to be the easiest way to get ready on OSX:

```
brew install ocaml
brew install opam
opam install jbuilder
```


Examples
--------

In the examples subdirectory is a simple SQL dispatcher script written against
the Ct module, and also one for the Dbi_freetds module.
